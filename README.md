Task - 02

Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

Dataset:- https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data?select=train.csv

The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset used in data science and machine learning for educational purposes. It contains information about the passengers who were aboard the RMS Titanic when it sank on its maiden voyage in April 1912. The goal of analyzing this dataset is often to predict which passengers survived the disaster based on various features.

The data has been split into two groups:

1.training set (train.csv)

2.test set (test.csv)

For data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), we typically use the train.csv file because it contains both the features and the target variable (Survived). The test.csv file is usually used for predictions.
